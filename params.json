{"name":"MapEx Widget","tagline":"This is an advanced version of Yootheme's Map Widget (Widgetkit2). It adds access to the original Google Map object which can be used, for example, to support responsive behavior or correct visualization in UIKit modal dialog.","body":"# Overview\r\n**MapEx** is an advanced Map widget for [Yootheme Widgetkit2](https://yootheme.com/widgetkit). After installation it becomes available in the Widgets list as a \"native\" widget and can be used with any [Warp 7 theme](https://yootheme.com/themes). This widget is based on the original Yootheme's [Map widget](http://yootheme.com/demo/widgetkit/joomla/index.php/home/map) and adds just a very compact modification to it, so that it can be easily upgraded (if necessary) when a new version of the original widget will be available. In order to use extra features of this widget you will have to use Javascript code (examples below).\r\n\r\n## Features\r\nThis widget adds access to the original [Google Map object](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#Map) that is used in creation of the map. So, the user may change and/or modify the object as he needs from any web page using Javascript. All other behavior, styling and features of the original [Map widget](http://yootheme.com/demo/widgetkit/joomla/index.php/home/map) are preserved.\r\n\r\n## Use cases or why it's better than original Map?\r\nUsually the user may want to use the object to add new features or fix problems of the original Map Widget such as:\r\n* **Responsive behavior** - the map will automatically adjust (pan & zoom) if the user changes the window size or orientation (on mobile devices). Responsive behavior is not available in the original [Map widget](http://yootheme.com/demo/widgetkit/joomla/index.php/home/map), e.g. [post in Yootheme forum](https://yootheme.com/component/answers/question/52808).\r\n* **Center map** - you can put an arbitrary center of the map. This feature is not available in the original [Map widget](http://yootheme.com/demo/widgetkit/joomla/index.php/home/map), problem exists since 2013, e.g. posts at Yootheme forum: [post#1](https://yootheme.com/component/answers/question/75957), [post#2](https://yootheme.com/component/answers/question/52808)\r\n* **Correct visualization** of the widget if it's displayed inside the [UIKit modal dialog](http://getuikit.com/docs/modal.html). There's a problem with the original [Map widget](http://yootheme.com/demo/widgetkit/joomla/index.php/home/map) when the widget is not rendered correctly when displayed inside the modal dialog: the map tiles are not rendered completely or partly, so the widget is not visible properly. This MapEx widget fixes this issue.\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\nWe use \"clean\" and \"neat\" approach according to the official Yootheme's manual:\r\n* [Custom widgetkit plugin](http://yootheme.com/widgetkit/documentation/customizing/custom-widget-plugin)\r\n* [Where to store your customizations](https://yootheme.com/widgetkit/documentation/customizing/where-to-store-your-customizations)\r\nSuch approach allows you to:\r\n1. keep original Yootheme's Widgetkit source files\r\n1. preserve original Yootheme's functionality\r\n1. safely do updates to Yootheme's files (download new versions of Widgetkit 2), keeping our new widget (modifications won't be overwritten during update process)\r\n\r\nThe installation is very simple. You just need to copy the folder _map_ex_ to _/templates/THEME-NAME/widgetkit/widgets/_, so that you will have a folder _/templates/THEME-NAME/widgetkit/widgets/map_ex_. The _THEME-NAME_ is a folder of your theme, e.g. it can be _yoo_vida_, _yoo_finch_, etc. After copying you should reload the widgetkit control panel page, so that the widget will appear in the list:\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThanks Lucas for showing a trick how to refresh Map Widget with jQuery.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with MapEx Widget?
